Asquell Scripting Language
==========================
The fairly average lovechild of Assembly and SQL


Description
===========

I wanted to create a simple language with most of the standard features and was easily extendable.
Asquell is not designed to be a fast language or a language replacement of things like Java or C#.
Asquell is designed to be flexible and easy to learn.


Features
========
